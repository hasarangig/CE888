#  Empathy Assessment using Eye Tracker Data

This repository contains RNN and Random Forest models for empathy assessment using Eyet4empathy dataset

# Overview
The RNN and Random Forest models in this repository were developed to predict empathy level based on eye tracker data.The models was trained on Eyet4empathy dataset and  and can be used to predict empathy scores for new data.

# Requirements
To use these models, you will need:

*  Python 3.6 or higher
*  Tensorflow 2.0 or higher (for the RNN model)
*  Scikit-Learn 0.24 or higher (for the Random Forest model)

# Usage
To use these models, you can follow these steps:

*  Clone this repository: git clone https://github.com/hasarangig/CE888.git
*  Install the required libraries
*  Load the model 
*  Load the data (Data used to train and test the model are available here
*  Use the model to predict empathy scores
